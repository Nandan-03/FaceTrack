# Face Recognition and PDF Report Generation API

This is a Flask-based API for processing images, detecting faces, recognizing identities, and generating PDF reports with the results. The API uses OpenCV for face detection, Keras FaceNet for face recognition, and ReportLab for PDF generation.

## Features

- Detect faces in images using Haar Cascade Classifier.
- Recognize identities using Keras FaceNet.
- Generate PDF reports with identified identities and annotated images.
- Download generated PDF reports.
